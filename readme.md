## Prime Number Generator

This program finds prime numbers and writes them to a file named "output.txt".

**Features:**

- Efficient prime checking algorithm using base cases and divisibility tests.
- Writes prime numbers continuously to an output file.

**How to Use:**

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc prime_generator.c -o prime_generator).
2. Run the program (e.g., ./prime_generator).
3. The program will run indefinitely, finding and writing prime numbers to "output.txt."

**Important Note:**

The program uses an infinite loop to generate an unlimited number of primes.  To stop the program, press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal. 

**Dependencies:**

- C compiler

**Output:**

The program will create a file named "output.txt" containing a list of prime numbers.
